{"text": "Cisco DNA Center is a powerful network controller and management dashboard that lets you take charge of your network, optimize your Cisco investment, and lower your IT spending. Cisco DNA Center provides a single dashboard for every fundamental management task to simplify running your network. With this platform, IT can respond to changes and challenges faster and more intelligently.â—      Design: Design your network using intuitive workflows, starting with locations where your network devices will be deployed. Users of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module (APIC-EM) can simply import existing network designs and device images into Cisco DNA Center.â—      Policy: Define user and device profiles that facilitate highly secure access and network segmentation based on business needs. Application policies allow your business-critical applications to provide a consistent level of performance regardless of network congestion.â—      Provision: Use policy-based automation to deliver services to the network based on business priority and to simplify device deployment. Zero-touch device provisioning and software image management features reduce device installation or upgrade time from hours to minutes and bring new remote offices online with plug-and-play ease from an off-the-shelf Cisco device. Additionally, the Cisco StealthwatchÂ® Security Analytics service provisions network elements to send NetFlow and Encrypted Traffic Analytics (ETA) to Stealthwatch.â—      Assurance: Cisco DNA Assurance enables every point on the network to become a sensor, sending continuous streaming telemetry on application performance and user connectivity in real time. This, coupled with automatic path-trace visibility and guided remediation, means network issues are resolved in minutes â€” before they become problems. Automated NetFlow switch configuration for Cisco Stealthwatch security provides detection and mitigation of threats, even when they are hidden in encrypted traffic.â—      Platform: An open and extensible platform allows third-party applications and processes to exchange data and intelligence with Cisco DNA Center.", "metadata": "Introduction"}
{"text": "Cisco DNA Center is a software solution that resides on the Cisco DNA Center appliance. The solution receives data in the form of streaming telemetry from every device (switch, router, access point, and wireless access controller) on the network. This data provides Cisco DNA Center with the real-time information it needs for the many functions it performs. For a device to be authorized to send data to Cisco DNA Center, that device must be included in your companyâ€™s Cisco DNA software license subscription. Cisco encourages customers to purchase complete Cisco DNA Center functionality through a Cisco DNA Advantage or Premier license subscription. Limited Cisco DNA Center functionality is also available through a Cisco DNA Essentials license subscription. Wireless, switching, and SD-WAN and routing subscriptions are available for 3- and 5-year terms; wireless and switching are also available in a 7-year term.", "metadata": "Licensing"}
{"text": "Cisco DNA Centerâ€™s latest release, 2.1.2.4, is a major update to this solution, with enhancements that greatly facilitate SDA policy and segmentation, identification of network endpoints, Wi-Fi 6 upgrades, power-over-Ethernet (PoE) management, and security and ITSM integrations. The main deliverables of Cisco DNA Center 2.1.2.4 are:â—      Updated navigation: The Cisco DNA Center GUI now has more streamlined navigation through an easy-to-use menu with simplified headers. The new menu centralizes the user experience, making it easy to locate all functions and tasks in Cisco DNA Center. The user will see many new features, and all of the previous features in Cisco DNA Center. Users that are having trouble finding a feature in the new menu, can use global search to locate it. The menu has a black background that makes the menu options stand out clearly.â—      Machine reasoning engine enhancements: Cisco DNA Center is now more intelligent. It adds to its already extensive AI/ML-enabled features with a greatly expanded Machine Reasoning Engine (MRE). This new MRE defines the next intelligence evolution and helps in complex workflows where the result of one action determines the next. It closely resembles how human beings themselves reason things out and accomplish multistep tasks. An example where Cisco DNA Center uses MRE is to find and fix potentially crippling routing loops that require a careful analysis spanning multiple devices. This allows your new IT team members to accomplish complex tasks instead of escalating them, and for your more seasoned IT team members it saves time by automating tedious workflows. For more information, read the blog: https://blogs.cisco.com/networking/machine-reasoning-is-the-new-ai-ml-technology-that-will-save-you-time-and-facilitate-offsite-netopsâ—      AI endpoint analytics: This feature allows Cisco DNA Center to identify and classify endpoint devices on a campus network. Through the use of various profiling methods, including Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and machine learning, AI endpoint analytics establishes visibility of what is on the network so that new endpoints can be authenticated and assigned an appropriate policy for network usage, security, and segmentation.", "metadata": "New features"}

Cisco DNA Automation features and benefitsFeatureDescription and benefitsNetwork discoveryAutomatically discovers and maps network devices to a physical topology with detailed device-level data. The discovery function uses the following protocols and methods to retrieve device information, such as IP addresses, neighboring devices, and hosts connected to the device:â—  Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)â—  Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for endpointsâ—  IP Device Tracking (IPDT) and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) entries for host discoveryâ—  LLDP Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED) for discovering IP phones and some serversâ—  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) versions 2 and 3Network Information Database (NIDB)Periodically scans the network to create a â€œsingle source of truthâ€ for IT. This inventory includes all network devices, along with an abstraction for the entire enterprise network. It keeps an updated inventory of devices and software images on that device for version control. The NIDB provides data to applications (such as SWIM and Cisco EasyQoS) so that the correct device and image version are used. It allows applications to be device independent, so configuration differences between devices arenâ€™t a problem.MerakiÂ® discovery and integrationProvides for the discovery of all Meraki devices on the network and integrates them into the Cisco DNA Center dashboard. It provides for a single pane of glass for both Cisco and Meraki devices.Network design and profile-based managementAllows you to manage your network in a hierarchical fashion by letting you add areas and buildings on a geospatial map. You can start by defining your sites, then add buildings to sites, and finally add floors with detailed floor plans to the buildings. Cisco DNA Center lets the user define profiles, which consist of common network settings such as device credentials, DHCP, DNS server, AAA server, IP address pool, etc. Wireless settings such as SSIDs and RF profiles can be created globally and customized at site levels. These profiles form the basis for network automation.Network Plug and Play (PnP)Zero-touch provisioning for new device installation.

Notice that the entry-level Gen2 appliance (DN2-HW-APL) has the same size, performance, and capacity specifications as the first-generation (Gen1) Cisco DNA Center appliance (DN1-HW-APL). The reason for the change is to put all three Gen2 appliances on the newer Cisco UCSÂ® M5 series of servers. If you currently have a Gen1 appliance (based on the Cisco UCS M4 series), there is no need to upgrade, and there is no advantage to upgrading, since both Gen1 and Gen2 entry appliances are based on the same 44-core processing units, have the same performance specifications, and support the same capacity of devices, sites, IP-pools, etc. Customers looking for greater performance, in order to support more capacity, are advised to upgrade to the 56-core â€œmidsizeâ€ Gen2 appliance (DN2-HW-APL-L) or the 112-core â€œlargeâ€ Gen2 appliance (DN2-HW-APL-XL).", "metadata": "Appliance scale"}
